The modules in this package were copied unmodified from [here](https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/mooc-jutut/tree/bf00998849579447ef773dcf673d69a72e6fa7fc/aplus_client).
When the `aplus-client` becomes available as an installable library, this directory becomes redundant and can be replaced with the library.
